# terrarium
An attempt to do a Terraria clone game, with some new features.

It is still in the first stages, so its pretty dumb.

It's coded in C++, using Allegro 5 and Box2D. Currently we're using Eclipse IDE with its CDT plugin. Previously we have been using CodeLite and QtCreator shortly after, so there are branches using their project layout (but the code is mostly oudated).
