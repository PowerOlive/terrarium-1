- For the tweaked debug, note that it's not possible to compile the game on LAB2 when Allegro libs compiled on LAB3 are on .local/lib

TODO:

* Check minor sprite glitch when too many blocks on the screen (reproducible on DCC's PCs)
* Need to remake the visible area mechanism to avoid scrolling the visible area when the player is in the boundaries of the map
* Need to create a valid *.tmx map loader and saver. 75% DONE, needs valid TMX saver
* Need to adapt the generators to the current Map classes.
